# String Theory in Space
 The following is the project files for my entry into the local multiplayer game jam. This was originally made in 2014.
# How to play
 One player uses WASD and the other player used the arrow keys to move. When you die, press space to restart.
# About
 This project was made in Lua using the Love2D game engine.
