# String Theory in Space 🎮
This game is my entry for the local multiplayer game jam, originally held in 2014. The original upload of the game can be found [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/string-theory-in-space/31385). The game was made using Lua with the Love2D game engine.

## How to play ❓
One player uses WASD and the other player uses the arrow keys to move. When you die, press space to restart. Dodge the asteroids coming towards you, but be careful! Your partner is attached to you by an elastic rope. Move too far apart and you will be quickly pulled back together. The more asteroids you dodge, the higher your score.
