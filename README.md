# String Theory in Space
 The following is the project files for my entry into the local multiplayer game jam. This was originally made in 2014. The link to the gamejolt upload https://gamejolt.com/games/string-theory-in-space/31385
# How to play
 One player uses WASD and the other player used the arrow keys to move. When you die, press space to restart.
